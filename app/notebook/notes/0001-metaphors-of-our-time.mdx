> To discover truth, it is necessary to work within the metaphors of our own time, which are for the most part technological.
>
> Today artificial intelligence and information technologies have absorbed many of the questions that were once taken up by
> theologians and philosophers: the mind’s relationship to the body, the question of free will, the possibility of immortality.
> These are old problems, and although they now appear in different guises and go by different names, they persist in conversations
> about digital technologies much like those dead metaphors that still lurk in the syntax of contemporary speech.
>
> All the eternal questions have become engineering problems.
